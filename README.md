# dayz-map-hack-front-end
It's an old project for a tile-map front-end for a custom dayz-mod map-hack. The code is horrible by any standards, but I'm still impressed that I did it then all by myself.

Doesn't make sense to use it without the C#-hack backend. So.. Just to show my horrible code here.
